# Test Notes

## Into

Short SpaceX TypeScript application shows list of last 50 Launches, with ability to sort by date or launch name.
It is possible to filter out launches by name, and see rocket details, which are presented at the top.

## Questions
- Requirement is not clear whether should sort 50 retrieved or give different result by changing sort.
- What is launch names ? mission_name
- What is details, I mean what information to put in details about rocket ?
- More test could be added but wanted to be within some time limit.
